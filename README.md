# If_I_make_OS
What if I had the chance to make an OS, what functionalities I will made?

##System Level ShortName comment
I will make a system level short cut query module, to show every short cut meanings when it's needed
##System level ShortCut action
I will make a every UI that counts has a short cut ,and make a rule to how to use
##I will make the desktop has the normal ability to show every thing 
## Anywhere command
A trigger to tell the os that user is eager to make a command,
then the os will listen to the keyboard input ,and run the command
anywhere especially when edit
this may take part of the role of shortcut
and may show a little box  to show where whe command is on
cmd window is every fast to open.
