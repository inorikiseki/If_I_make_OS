# Strict window alignmet

all UI components can be fit in most aspect ration change.
auto align is on by defauly.
a window new on the screen will be managed by the os itself other than 
the os give the power to it back.

and won get the desk overlap much 

like the today 's phone the split screen 
.
but more flexiable
and make it compitale with mobile device.
